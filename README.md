## Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
## Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook, Power BI

## Project Overview

Employee attrition is one of the most costly challenges for modern organizations. High turnover negatively impacts productivity, recruitment expenses, team morale, and long-term performance.
In this project, I performed a full end-to-end HR analytics workflow, using the IBM HR Analytics dataset to uncover hidden drivers of workforce attrition, identify high-risk employee groups, and provide data-driven recommendations for retention strategy.



## Analytics Approach

1️⃣ Data Loading & Initial Exploration

- Loaded HR dataset into a Jupyter Notebook
- Reviewed structure, columns, data types
- Checked for missing values & anomalies
- Verified class imbalance in target variable (Attrition)


2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Cleaning included:
- Fixing incorrect data types
- Standardizing categorical values
- Removing duplicates
- Handling inconsistencies in fields such as department, marital status, job role
- Creating clean and analysis-ready DataFrame

This ensures reliable analysis and prevents misleading insights.


3️⃣ Feature Engineering

- Created meaningful new variables to improve analysis
Feature engineering gives HR actionable segments instead of raw data.



4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Performed in-depth analysis answering key business questions:
🔹Attrition Rate Overview
🔹Univariate & Bivariate Analysis

- Analyzed relationships between attrition and employee key drivers.

🔹 Key Visuals (Python)
- Attrition by Age Group
- Attrition by Department
- Income vs Attrition
- Overtime vs Attrition
- Tenure Curve (Years at Company vs Attrition)
- Correlation Heatmap (Numerical Features)


5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created including:
- KPI Cards → Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate
- Filters/Slicers → Department, Role, Age Group
Charts:
- Attrition by Job Role
- Attrition by Age Group
- Salary Distribution
- Tenure vs Attrition
The dashboard allows HR managers to drill down into high-risk groups instantly.


## Key Insights 

1️⃣ High-Risk Roles

Roles with the highest attrition include:
- Sales Representatives
- Laboratory Technicians
- HR staff
- Research Scientists
Reason: High stress, competitive job market, workload imbalance.


2️⃣ High-Risk Age Groups

Highest attrition was observed in:
- Younger employees (18–30)
- Motivated by better pay and growth opportunities.
- Mid-career employees (31–40) showed moderate risk.
- Older employees (45+) showed very low attrition.


3️⃣ High-Risk Salary Bands

Employees earning below the median salary showed much higher attrition.
Low-income employees often leave due to:
- Salary dissatisfaction
- Better external offers
- Higher financial pressure


4️⃣ Overtime Strongly Predicts Attrition

Employees regularly working overtime leave at significantly higher rates. This suggests:
- Burnout risk
- Staffing shortages
- Poor work-life balance


5️⃣ Tenure Curve Reveals Attrition Pattern

Attrition is highest for:
- Employees in their first 2 years
- Employees with 7–10 years of tenure
- Low risk beyond 10 years.
This pattern helps shape onboarding and career development programs.
